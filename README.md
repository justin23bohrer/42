# 42
Did you know 42 is the national game of Texas? Well, me neither until my grandma told me. 
I am currently making a game where you can learn how to play 42 and play against AI's. This game will be made through Godot and use GDScript. I am also going to be playing around with visuals and shaders to make the game have a cool feel.
